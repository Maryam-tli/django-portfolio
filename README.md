## Overview

This is my personal portfolio website built using Django. The site showcases my projects by providing links to their GitHub repositories, along with detailed information about myself. I have utilized HTML, CSS, images, and a dedicated contact section where visitors can send me messages directly. All data—including contact messages—is stored using SQLite by default.

## Features

- **Personal Projects:** A comprehensive list of my projects with direct links to their GitHub pages.
- **About Me:** A dedicated section where I share information about my background, skills, and interests.
- **Responsive Design:** Clean and responsive user interface developed with HTML and CSS.
- **Visual Enhancements:** Use of images to complement the content and add a personal touch.
- **Contact Form:** A built-in contact section that allows visitors to send messages directly. These messages are stored in the SQLite database.

## Technologies Used

- **Django:** The Python web framework used to build the application.
- **HTML/CSS:** For structuring and styling the website.
- **SQLite:** The default database engine used to store content and contact messages.
